<h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Caroline Siedlarczyk. 
        I am eighteen years old and a freshman at Lewis University. I enjoy playing videogames, reading,
        writing & listening to music. My favorite game of all time would have to be minecraft. I have
        two younger sisters, one's middle school while the other is in highschool. I also have a three
        year old dog named Rosie. I'm majoring in Computer Science and plan to minor in Data Science.

    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>

        <p>Reading is my favorite hobby. I just enjoy being able to settle down after a long day 
            and take out a good book to read. I like to read any kind of book, no matter the genre
            though I do have a preference for fiction.
