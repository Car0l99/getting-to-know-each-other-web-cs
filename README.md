<h3>&#128123;Introduction&#128123;</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Caroline Siedlarczyk.

        writing & listening to music. My favorite game of all time would have to be minecraft. I have
        two younger sisters, one's middle school while the other is in highschool. I also have a three
        year old dog named Rosie. I'm majoring in Computer Science and plan to minor in Data Science.
